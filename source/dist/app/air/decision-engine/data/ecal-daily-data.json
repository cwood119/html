This process is only being used due to the delay in implementation of PAMA, where this type of reduction in reimbursement would not be permitted.","url":"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/cms-proposal-threatens-availability-standard-121500247.html"},{"ticker":"CDNA","figi_ticker":"CDNA:US","figi":"BBG006JS5785","title":"CareDx Launches Olerup QTYPE® at ASHI","publication_date":"2016-09-30 00:31:01 +0000","summary":"[at noodls] - BRISBANE, Calif., September 28, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) - CareDx, Inc.
