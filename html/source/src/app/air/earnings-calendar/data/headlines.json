Piper Jaffray’s Andrew Nowinski reiterated a Neutral rating but raised his price target $1 to $9: Brocade reported FQ3(Jul) results that were slightly above the high-end of guidance, driven by a strong contribution from Ruckus. However, excluding Ruckus, the Ethernet segment was below expectations, primarily due to weaker than expected US Fed demand. Fibre Channel storage results were in-line with expectations, which was somewhat surprising given the strong demand trends reported by NetApp, Pure Storage and Nimble. While the Ruckus acquisition is performing better than expected and the company has yet to realize any cost synergies, we remain concerned with weak performance in the Storage and IP Ethernet segments. RBC Capital Markets’ Mitch Steves reiterated a Sector Perform rating on the stock: Brocade reported solid results at $591M/$0.21 vs. street at $567M/$0.17, however we note that the beat was inorganic with Ruckus contributing $78M in the quarter vs. expectations closer to $50-60M."},{"title":"Technology Sector Update for 08/26/2016: SPLK,QADA,BRCD","publication_date":"2016-08-26 18:02:41 +0000","url":"http://articlefeeds.nasdaq.com/~r/nasdaq/symbols/~3/Cuk1M2ZsbOY/technology-sector-update-for-08262016-splkqadabrcd-cm670901","summary":"Top Tech Stocks MSFT 0.43% AAPL 0.73% IBM 0.08% CSCO 0.03% GOOG 0.14% Technology stocks were slightly lower today, with shares of tech companies in the S&P 500 declining about 0.2%.

Production for the underlying properties at the Waddell Ranch was 85,634 barrels of oil and 416,723 Mcf of gas. The production for the Trust's allocated portion of the Waddell Ranch was 33,713 barrels of oil and 162,544 Mcf of gas. The average price for oil was $33.32 per bbl and for gas was $1.50 per Mcf.
